### Synopsis
bored I felt it completely appropriate to orchestrate an impulse marriage between our dearly beloved React and Django.


but uh... except.. this project only includes React

yeah. Sorry about that

React is part 1

Part 2 is coming tomorrow


### Code Review
section coming soon stay tuned

### final thought
#### this project is to be a no rough stuff type of deal, or put better a quick 2 hour max project.
